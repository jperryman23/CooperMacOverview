## Keyboard Shortcuts

**Duration:** About 30 minutes

A **keyboard shortcut** is a series of one or more keys that when pressed at the same time will trigger an application or operating system action. Simply put, using keyboard shortcuts instead of the trackpad or mouse will make you a more productive web developer. For example, imagine that a single keyboard shortcut could save you 3 seconds of unnecessary moving and clicking the pointer. It might not seem like much, but if performed 20 times per day, you'd save yourself 6 hours over the course of one year. And that's just one keyboard shortcut!

In this chapter, your objective is to demonstrate competency with the most common keyboard shortcuts on macOS.
