## Algebra Basics

**Duration:** About 2 hours

**Algebra** is the study of using variables to represent unknown values in a mathematical equation. Engineers, scientists, economists, and, of course, web developers use algebra to model the physical world and answer questions like:

- What's the ideal curvature of a trumpet bell?
- How much force does it take to throw a ball 50 meters?
- When's the best day of the week to travel from San Francisco to Seattle?
- How long will it take a social network to gain 100,000 active users?

In this chapter, your objective is to demonstrate competency with the basics of algebra. To complete this objective, please follow along with the videos found below and complete the self-assessment at the end of this chapter. If you're already familiar with algebra, you may be able to complete the self-assessment without watching the video. Though, you may also learn a trick or two from it.
